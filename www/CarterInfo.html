                                <li>If there is no casualty and only the motor vehicles are
                                    damaged in the accident, the drivers of both the vehicles should
                                    take their respective vehicles to the side of the road to ensure
                                    that the traffic is not obstructed. Drivers of both the vehicles
                                    should note down the names, address, details of licenses and the
                                    number of each other's vehicles and duly register a complaint at the
                                    local police station.</li>
                                <li>The insurance company should be informed immediately so that
                                    compensation could be claimed for the vehicles damaged.</li>
                                <li>If you have committed some accident and injured a person, you are
                                    duty bound to take the person to the hospital and inform the
                                    incident to the police. If it is not possible to remove the injured
                                    to hospital, go to the nearest police station and inform about full
                                    facts. Any non-compliance of this rule shall make you liable for
                                    enhanced punishment.</li>
                                <li>If any you come across a person, injured in an accident, try to
                                    help him. Provide first aid to the injured and take steps to remove
                                    the injured to the nearest hospital. The registration number and the
                                    name of the driver and other details of the vehicle, that has caused
                                    the accident should be noted down and should be reported to the
                                    nearest police station immediately.</li>
                                <li>Do not believe in the misnomer that helping an accident victim
                                    will lead to harassment by the police. At best, police officer may
                                    ask for your statement, that too at hospital itself.</li>

                                <li>Every policeman is duty bound to ensure that women are
                                    treated with due respect. There is no exception to this rule.</li>
                                <li>In cases, where a woman is complainant, police will make enquiries
                                    and investigations expeditiously and arrest the accused immediately.</li>
                                <li>When an occasion to arrest a woman or to interrogate a woman
                                    witness arises, it is binding upon the police to keep a woman police
                                    personnel present.</li>
                                <li>If a woman is accused, she shall be treated with dignity,

                                <li>Normally, neither women be arrested, nor called to a police
                                    station between sunset and sunrise. However, under exceptional
                                    circumstances, if it is necessary to arrest them or call them to a
                                    police station, it is binding upon the police to allow their
                                    relatives to stay with them.</li>
                                <li>Accused women are to be kept in the cells specially reserved for
                                    them. If there is no separate room for them, they are to be kept in
                                    the visitor's room.</li>
                                <li>A rape victim may ask for her medical examination to be conducted
                                    by a female doctor.</li>
                                <li>She can also choose to give her statement to lady police
                                    personnel. As far as practicable, a lady police officer shall be
                                    deputed for this job. If it is not possible, it shall be ensured
                                    that some local women must be present at the time of registration of
                                    FIR and recording of statement.</li>
                                <li>Mumbai Police is committed to provide a decent treatment to all
